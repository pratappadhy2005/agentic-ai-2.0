      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 49. Hmm, let me start by remembering what a square root actually is. From what I recall in math class, the square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 49, I need to find a number that times itself equals 49.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think... 49 is a pretty common number, so maybe it's a perfect square. Perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, etc., right? Each of these is the square of an integer. For example, 7 times 7 is 49. Wait, that might be it. Let me check that again. 7 multiplied by 7... 7 times 7 is indeed 49. So does that mean the square root of 49 is 7? That seems right.\n",
      "\n",
      "But hold on, I think square roots can also have negative numbers because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, technically, both 7 and -7 squared would give 49. So, does that mean the square root of 49 is both 7 and -7? Or is it just the positive one?\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember my teacher mentioning something about the principal square root. Let me recall... The principal square root is the non-negative one. So when someone asks for the square root without specifying, they usually mean the principal square root. So in that case, the answer would be 7. But if they're asking for all square roots, then both 7 and -7 are valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the question here just says \"the square root of 49,\" so maybe they want the principal square root. Let me confirm that. Let me think of how calculators handle this. If I type in the square root of 49 on a calculator, it would give me 7, right? Because calculators typically return the principal square root.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the positive root. Let me also think about factors of 49. The factors of 49 are 1, 7, and 49. Since 7 times 7 is 49, that's the square. So, yeah, 7 is definitely a square root. But the negative counterpart is also a square root. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the original question is straightforward: \"What's the square root of 49?\" Since it doesn't specify positive or negative, but in most contexts, especially in basic math, the square root symbol √ refers to the principal (non-negative) root. So the answer should be 7. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me also verify this by squaring 7. 7 multiplied by 7: 7 times 7 is 49. Yep, that works. And -7 times -7 is also 49 because a negative times a negative is a positive. But again, unless they specify they want both, the answer is 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there's a way to double-check. Maybe using exponents? 49 can be written as 7 squared, so the square root of 7 squared is 7. That cancels out the square root. So √(7²) = 7. Therefore, √49 = 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, prime factorization of 49. Let's see, 49 divided by 7 is 7, so 49 is 7 multiplied by 7. So in prime factors, 49 is 7². Therefore, taking the square root of 7² gives 7. That solidifies the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a second, maybe I should also consider if there's any other number that could square to 49. Let's see, 6 squared is 36, which is too small. 8 squared is 64, which is too big. So between 6 and 8, only 7 works. So 7 is the integer square root. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the principal square root of 49 is 7, and the negative root is -7, but unless specified, the answer is 7. Therefore, the square root of 49 is 7.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The square root of 49 is **7**. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Definition**: The square root of a number \\( x \\) is a number \\( y \\) such that \\( y \\times y = x \\).\n",
      "2. **Calculation**: \n",
      "   - \\( 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\)\n",
      "   - \\( (-7) \\times (-7 = 49) \\)\n",
      "3. **Principal Square Root**: By convention, the square root symbol (√) refers to the **principal (non-negative) square root**. \n",
      "4. **Conclusion**: Thus, \\( \\sqrt{49} = 7 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "While \\(-7\\) is also a square root of 49, it is not the principal root. So the answer is **7**.\n"
